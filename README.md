# Basic Language test for Angular 9

  

This is a basic translations app for Angular 9.

  

It contains FR and DE translations.

  

$ npm run start

$ npm run start:fr -- --port=4201

$ npm run start:de -- --port=4202

  
  

## Notes

you can add locales in the /src/locale directory.

  

You would also need to amend the angular.json file to include build and serve options for the new languages (see FR as an example).

Also update the package.json to allow for npm to run the code
